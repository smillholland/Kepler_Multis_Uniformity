Same Star -- Same Planets
==================================================

This respository contains supplementary material to the paper, Millholland, S., Wang, S., \& Laughlin, G. 2017. <i> Kepler Multi-Planet Systems Exhibit Unexpected Intra-system Uniformity in Mass and Radius. </i> 

The IPython notebook entitled "Kepler_Multi_Uniformity_Oct17.ipynb" contains all analyses involving the Hadden \& Lithwick (2017) dataset of TTV mass estimates. It includes the calculations presented in Section 2 of the paper and additional supplementary plots. Note that there is no random number seed, so figures may look slightly different than those presented in the paper. The code relies on the data files named "Hadden_Lithwick_2017_data" and "cks_physical_merged.csv". The latter of these is the CKS dataset (Petigura et al. 2017, Johnson et al. 2017), which was downloaded from https://github.com/California-Planet-Search/cks-website.  <br />

The notebook entitled "Kepler_Multi_Uniformity_Oct17_LinearRegression.ipynb" is the multiple regression analysis presented in Section 3 of the paper. It also includes details that were not shown in the paper, such as comparisons between the linear regression results and non-parametric tests of correlations. This code uses the data files named "cks_physical_merged.csv" and "Furlan_2017_data", which is Table 9 of Furlan et al. (2017).
